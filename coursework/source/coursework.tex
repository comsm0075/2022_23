\section*{Coursework: Analysing deep neural networks as brain models}

For this coursework you are asked to implement and explore the
behaviour of backprop using supervised learning and a deep neural
network as a potential model for information processing in the
brain. For implementation we suggest that you use lab1 as a starting
point and Python or Julia in particular.

\subsection*{1. Implement the backpropagation algorithm in the supervised context}

The backpropagation algorithm is often used in machine learning to
solve the credit assignment problem. Here you are going to contrast
its different elements such as error backpropagation, or symmetric
weights, on how the brain is organised. You should use a simple
feedforward neural network with one or two hidden layers and sigmoidal
units to teach the network to classify the widely used fashion MNIST
dataset\footnote{\texttt{github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist}}; to
simplify the problem you can reduce the dataset to five of the ten
labels. Do not use autograd tools as in pytorch for this simple
task. You should use a mean squared cost as discussed in the lectures
and a one-hot output\footnote{\texttt{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot}}
encoding to represent the fashion MNIST classes.  Include brief
snippets of your code in the report. Note: Although here you are asked
to implement the backprop algorithm in a supervised setting, backprop
is also used in unsupervised (e.g. autoencoders) and reinforcement
learning (e.g. deep RL).

You should use the lectures and you may also use these or related
papers as references when contrasting backprop with the brain:

  assignment problem, Current Opinion in Neurobiology 2019.
\item Sacramento et al., NeuralIPS 2018,
  (\texttt{arXiv.org:1810.11393})
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection*{2. Analyse the deep network using information theory}

Recently information theory has been used to study the dynamics of
learning in deep learning networks; here you will examine the mutual
information between the image label and the network activity: you can
imagine a communication channel
$$
 \mbox{label} \rightarrow \mbox{image} \rightarrow \mbox{hidden layer} \rightarrow \mbox{output}
$$
 in which the image label is encoded in the image itself and that in
turn is encoded in the activity of the hidden layer and then in the
output layer. The aim is to quantify information flow in this channel,
at least in a discrete approximation in which neurons are either on or
off. Thus a random variable representing a layer will take
binary-sequence values with ones and zeros corresponding to neurons
being “on” or “off” based on their activation. The probability for
each binary sequence can be estimated by counting the number of images
that produce that sequence; note that for the hidden layer many will
have zero estimated probability.

 \subsection*{Questions }

 \begin{enumerate}

 \item Biological relevance of backprop 

\begin{enumerate}
   
    \item \textsl{How does the algorithm work?} Explain the algorithm (with
      equations) and plot the different components over learning to
      help you explain its behaviour, for example what are the weight changes
      given by backprop and the different terms that make up the
      gradient. You should also plot the performance (i.e. cost) of
      the algorithm over learning iterations (i.e. the learning
      curve). You should include a snippet of the key component of
      your code in your report. [3/20 marks, max 500 words]

 \item \textsl{How does the algorithm relate to the brain?} Discuss how backprop
 relates to the brain. Can neural networks optimised with backprop
 explain neuroscience data? Here you are going to explore the
 biological plausibility of three of the key issues with backprop (you
 should discuss their implications and how important they are using
 simulations and the respective plots to support your arguments) [4/20
   marks, max 500 words]:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Weight transport problem 
    \item The need for derivative of the activation function
    \item Two phase learning 
\end{enumerate}
 
\item Discuss what are the key advantages of using supervised learning over the other two learning paradigms, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, both in terms of performance/data needs and biological plausibility. For this  [1.5/20 marks, max 250 words] 

\item What about disadvantages in terms of performance/data needs and biological plausibility? And how could this be improved upon? [1.5/20 marks, max 250 words] 
\end{enumerate}
 
\item Information theory analysis 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $X$ is a random variable representing the input, $H(X)$
      will be $\log(5)$ since there are five labels or $\log(10)$ if
      you are using the whole data set. Let $Y$ represent the
      discretized hidden layer activity, this means the components of
      $Y$ represent the activity of individual nodes of the hidden
      layer with an integer. One approach might be to find the average
      activity and use that as a cut-off with values exceeding it
      mapped to one and other values to zero.  Now, what is $H(Y|X)$
      and how does this change with learning? What about $I(X,Y)$? How
      are these dynamics changed if the number of hidden layer neurons
      is changed?  If $Z$ represents the activity of the output layer,
      how do $H(Z|X)$ and $I(X,Z)$ change? [5/20 marks, maximum 500
        words and four graphs]

    \item What happens if you consider some property of the image, for
      example, if the image is divided in four and $W$ is the random
      variable giving which quadrant has the largest amount of
      white. How do $I(W,Y)$ and $I(W,Z)$ change with learning? [3/20
        marks, maximum 250 words and two graphs]

    \item As a bonus question, you could consider the performance of
      an autoencoder. How does the mutual information of the image
      properties change with learning in this case? [2/20, maximum 250 word and two graphs]

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
 
 Submit your report on Blackboard (IPB > Assessment, submission and
 feedback) remembering that you need to submit to the `coursework'
 unit (COMSM0100) not the `teaching' unit (COMSM0075). No need to
 submit your full code (include snippets in the report), only the
 report in pdf or similar. Please add the necessary
 references/citations at the end.

 
\begin{itemize}
\item[Note 1]: Where possible cite papers and/or use simulations/plots to support your claims. 
\item[Note 2]: Collaborative work is encouraged for example, for coding and understanding of the algorithm, but every submission should be individual / unique. 
\end{itemize}
 

\subsubsection*{Support provided}

 We cannot provide direct support on the coursework, but we (TAs and
 Lecturers) can help with questions you might have about the lectures
 and labs/workshops. We will be available during the usual
 lab/workshop times as in your timetable though we may sometimes only be available online.

 \subsubsection*{Deadline}

The deadline for submission of all optional unit assignments is 13:00
on Thursday 8th of December: the University discourages Friday
deadlines. Students should submit all required materials to the
``Assessment, submission and feedback'' section of Blackboard - it is
essential that this is done on the Blackboard page related to the
``With Coursework'' variant of the unit.

 \subsubsection*{Time commitment and marking}

You are expected to work on both of your optional unit courseworks in
the three-week coursework period as if it were a working week in a regular
job - that is five days a week for no more than eight hours a day. The effort
spent on the assignment for each unit should be approximately equal,
being roughly equivalent to 1.5 working weeks each. It is up to you
how you distribute your time and workload between the two units within
those constraints.

You are strongly advised NOT to try and work excessive hours during
the coursework period: this is more likely to make your health worse
than to make your marks better. If you need further pastoral/mental
health support, please talk to your personal tutor, a senior tutor, or
the university wellbeing service.

 
 \subsubsection*{Academic Offences}

Academic offences, including submission of work that is not your own,
falsification of data/evidence or the use of materials without
appropriate referencing, are all taken very seriously by the
University. Suspected offences will be dealt with in accordance with
the University’s policies and procedures. If an academic offence is
suspected in your work, you will be asked to attend an interview with
senior members of the school, where you will be given the opportunity
to defend your work. The plagiarism panel is able to apply a range of
penalties, depending on the severity of the offence. These include:
requirement to resubmit work, capping of grades and the award of no
mark for an element of assessment.

 \subsubsection*{Extenuating circumstances}

If the completion of your assignment has been significantly disrupted
by serious health conditions, personal problems, periods of
quarantine, or other similar issues, you may be able to apply for
consideration of extenuating circumstances (in accordance with the
normal university policy and processes). Students should apply for
consideration of extenuating circumstances as soon as possible when
the problem occurs, using the following online form:
\texttt{https://www.bristol.ac.uk/request-extenuating-circumstances-form}

You should note however that extensions of any significant length are
not possible for optional unit assignments. If your application for
extenuating circumstances is successful, you may be required to retake
the assessment of the unit at the next available opportunity (for
example, during the summer reassessment period).
